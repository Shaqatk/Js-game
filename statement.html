Title -  Dungeon Adventure Time Travel<br>

Choices for columns 1 – 4<br>
Column A - The What:<br>
1) Make a website that is a kind of game (a game which is also an artwork)<br>
Column B - Subject/Theme Starting Point:
Definition of play:<br>
4 a (1): an act, way, or manner of proceeding.
Source:<br>
2) http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/play
Column C - Informing Theory/Logics:<br>
For A2, consider the multiple works we've discussed (in lecture and/or lab) regarding play and games:
Bogost - Ian Bogost's chapter, "The Rhetoric of Video Games" (w6-7)
The concept of procedurality. <br>
“Procedures (or processes) are sets of constraints that create possibility spaces, which can be explored through play.”<br>
“Procedural systems generate behaviors based on rule based models; they are machines capable of producing many outcomes, each conforming to the same overall guidelines”<br>
Column D - Page-Oriented OR JavaScript-Oriented option (minimum reqs.):<br>
We have chosen to do a Java Oriented page<br>

Articulate your concepts and intentions in a brief explanation of, guiding questions for, and/or artist's statement about your completed work. Minimum Articulation word count: 300 words / Suggested Maximum: <br>700 words<br>

Our idea for our A2 game is a Dungeon Adventure style of game, where you have to explore through rooms and complete puzzles to proceed to further rooms. Our plan was to make the setting for the game be York University, but make it resemble a dungeon to suggest how students view the school environment as a place you must “escape” whether it be at the end of the school day or at the end of your academic journey “graduation”. <br>

As you progress through the puzzle rooms they become harder and harder to signify the greater difficulties you face as you progress through your academic journey, like progressing through the semester and going from one year to the next of your program. Depending on how thoroughly you explore the rooms, there will be alternate outcomes when you proceed onwards (such as short cuts to farther rooms, and an alternate ending). At the end there is a boss you must defeat to complete the game.<br>

We focused on our concepts from column B and C to further develop our game and to guide us to a respectable end product. Our definition of play for column B “an act, way, or manner of proceeding.” is evident in our dungeon adventure game because to progress through the game you must find a way to proceed through the room/levels by exploring them thoroughly. 
<br>
For column C we chose to use Ian Bogost’s concept of procedurality to draw our inspiration from for our game. In the “The Rhetoric of Video Games” Bogost explains that “Procedures (or processes) are sets of constraints that create possibility spaces, which can be explored through play.” As well as “Procedural systems generate behaviors based on rule based models; they are machines capable of producing many outcomes, each conforming to the same overall guidelines” This concept supports our idea of rooms/levels that can be explored through play, as well as creating multiple/alternate outcomes depending on how well you explore the rooms.<br>
